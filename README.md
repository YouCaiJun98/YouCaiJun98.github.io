## What's up?  
### 2021/2/28  
* read [Bi-Real Net: Enhancing the Performance of 1-bit CNNs With Improved Representational Capability and Advanced Training Algorithm](https://youcaijun98.github.io/articles/BNN/Bi_Real.html)  
* start learning [layer2/final_model.py]()

### 2021/2/25  
* finish viewing [bnn_ops.py](https://youcaijun98.github.io/codez/awnas/aw_nas/ops/bnn_ops.html)  
* dive into [nn.avgpool2d](https://youcaijun98.github.io/Langs/Python/Packets/Torch/nn_avgpool2d.html)  
* relearn [concatenate](https://youcaijun98.github.io/Langs/Python/Packets/Torch/torch_cat.html)  
* note that `torch.squeeze` returns tensor **shares the storage with the input tensor**, so changing the contents of one will change the contents of the other.



### 2021/2/24  
* continue going through [bnn_ops.py](https://youcaijun98.github.io/codez/awnas/aw_nas/ops/bnn_ops.html)  
* learn the usage of [torch.nn.functional.pad](https://youcaijun98.github.io/Langs/Python/Packets/Torch/torch_nn_functional_pad.html)  
* learn the [difference](https://youcaijun98.github.io/Langs/Python/Packets/Torch/nn_Sequentialversusnn_ModuleList.html) between `nn.Sequential` and `nn.ModuleList`  


### 2021/2/23  
* going through [bnn_ops.py](https://youcaijun98.github.io/codez/awnas/aw_nas/ops/bnn_ops.html)  
* usage of [torch.ge\gt\le](https://youcaijun98.github.io/Langs/Python/Packets/Torch/torch_ge_gt_le.html)  
* tell `ctx` by `self` -> [This page](https://youcaijun98.github.io/Langs/Python/Packets/Torch/ctxvesusself.html)  


### 2021/2/22  
* learn the usage of [tmux](https://youcaijun98.github.io/techniques/folder3/LinuxRelated/tmux.html), with great pain.  
* [ipdb](https://youcaijun98.github.io/Langs/Python/Packets/ipdb.html)本当上手.  
* start speculating [bnn_ops.py](https://youcaijun98.github.io/codez/awnas/aw_nas/ops/bnn_ops.html)


### 2021/2/21
* upload a blog [staticmethod](https://youcaijun98.github.io/Langs/Python/Decorators/staticmethod.html).
